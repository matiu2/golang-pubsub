# Here's how I spent my time on this

 * 7:05 - Read the spec
 * 7:10-7:49 - Wrestled with `ptest` and the docker pubsub emaulation server. Decided to go with the docker server. Set up two docker vms with mysql and pubsub emulator
 * 7:49-8:05 - Thought about just doing it in rust with aws

 - Work. Cleaning up baby vomit. Coffee.

 * 19:19 - Started looking at https://www.zakariaamine.com/2020-04-04/testing-gcp-pusub-golang
